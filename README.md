# Movie Quiz

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to create a timed quiz using Javascript in tandem with HTML and CSS. Using DOM methods, I added little to no code to the HTML file, solely relying on Javascript to implement the changes to lists and block objects. I also included a countdown timer as well as sound effects for every right or wrong answer.
