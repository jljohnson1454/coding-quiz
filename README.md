# Coding Quiz

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to create a timed quiz using Javascript in tandem with HTML and CSS. Using DOM methods, I relied on Javascript to implement interactivity to the questions and answers. I also included a countdown timer and sound effects for every right or wrong answer.

## Languages Used
